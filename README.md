## Web Visual Studio Code

This is Web version of visual studio code software. 
Visual studio code is one of the most popular software that web developer use.
This is my favorite editor .I started with Notepad++ and then sublime and then bracket and finally i stopped at VSC.

After using it more than 2 year, I decided to create a WEB version of it in react. Just to test my skill. 

It just look like VSC. I working on it to add more functionality. If you like, please start contributing in it.
